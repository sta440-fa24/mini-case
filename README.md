# Introduction

Durham has historically been a major center of the American tobacco and textile industries. In recent years, Durham has experienced explosive population growth due to its position as an anchor of the Research Triangle Park and the high-tech industries it supports. Since 2005, Durham has solicited a third-party to conduct a regular survey among residents to help advise the cityâ€™s strategic growth plan. The purpose of the survey is to assist city administrators and planners in making decisions about prioritizing areas of the city to focus on and to identify potential areas for improvement. The survey contains a variety of questions regarding resident perception of life in Durham, as well as demographic factors and geographic data.

# Data

The data are from the 2022 Durham Resident survey; data and the survey instrument are provided in this repository. Note that you will have to do some data cleaning; the data are provided in Excel format and variable names are not well formatted. Question titles correspond to the numbered questions in the resident survey. Across all categorical fields, a **9** represents missing or N/A values and should be treated appropriately; for yes/no questions, a **1** represents "yes."

# Objective

In recent years, the cost of living in Durham, especially housing, has exploded. Your goal is to evaluate whether perceived resident ratings of Durham as a place to live (Q24) is associated with the length of time residents have lived in Durham (Q27). You *must* adjust for the resident's total annual household income and whether monthly housing costs (rent or mortgage) exceed 30% of the resident's monthly income, as well as other variables, either existing or derived, that you deem appropriate. 

# Deliverable

This assignment is due **Thursday, September 5 at 11:59 PM**. You must turn in a written report of maximum 3 pages. In this brief report, explain your methodology and write out your model in full mathematical detail, including for all variables used in your modeling. Display output from your model in a professional manner and answer the project objective using these results. Be sure to provide appropriate quantification of uncertainty and interpret the most relevant results from your model. Finally, briefly discuss any sociological or urban planning implications your model has on Durham's future development and growth plans.
